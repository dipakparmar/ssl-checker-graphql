# GraphQL API for Checking SSL Certificate info of the website.

A GraphQL API for retrieving information about SSL Certificate of the website. The API is built using GraphQL, a modern and flexible query language for APIs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm v6 or higher
- yarn or npm package manager ( I prefer yarn )

### Installing

1. Install as dependency:
   ```bash
   yarn add @dipakparmar/ssl-checker-graphql
   ```
2. Setup a server using the following code:

   ```js
   import { createSSLCheckerGraphQLServer } from '@dipakparmar/ssl-checker-graphql'

   const server = createSSLCheckerGraphQLServer({
     landingPage: true,
     graphqlEndpoint: '/alpha/graphql',
     graphiql: true,
   })

   server.listen(4000, () => {
     console.log('ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000')
   })
   ```

3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The server should now be running on http://localhost:4000 or port specified in .env file. You can now open the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000/alpha/graphql to start querying the API.

## Usage

The API supports the following query fields:

- `sslCheck`: Returns the SSL certificate information for a given domain.
